# Woo-Store-Vacation
Going on vacation? Use Woo Store Vacation settings to make sure your buyers are not disappointed by buying items and unexpectedly waiting a long time to receive them.

Woo Store Vacation Mode allows you to put your shop on pause or hold mode for a certain amount of time. This feature could be helpful if:

* You are traveling or ill.
* You are temporarily unable to run your shop.
* You need a quick break to catch up on current orders.

It may be a complicated process for an E-Commerce business owner to find the time to take a vacation, but when they do they need a plan for their online store.

When you turn on your store vacation mode, the plugin will display a custom notice in your shop and single product page(s), letting your buyers know you are on vacation. You can also add a customized message to your storefront and set the end date for vacation mode with a date-picker feature.

If you want customers to be able to see products and prices, but not be able to purchase any products, it is possible to turn on "Disable Purchase" option in order to remove the purchase functionality and add to cart button, until after you come back from vacation(holiday) or end date passed.
